Pick an industry and create the landing page for a hypothetical company, filling in as much detail as possible. Use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp)), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) or any other css library, if you want, and make sure it's responsive. Browse the internet for existing company pages and imitate as much as you can.
