# Lab 00: Polls

### Git Setup:
```sh
> git checkout main
> git pull
> git checkout -b your-name/django/lab00
```

Follow the [polls tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/) on the official django site, **skipping the [last part of 4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial04/#use-generic-views-less-code-is-better), and parts [5](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial05/) and [7](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial07/)**. This tutorial walks you through the development of a simple polling app. A poll question has multiple choices, and those choices can be voted upon, and the votes are tallied up.


### Git Add, Commit & Push:
```sh
> git add files-to-be-added
> git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
> git push -u origin your-name/django/lab00
```
Then go to the repository to create a PR.
