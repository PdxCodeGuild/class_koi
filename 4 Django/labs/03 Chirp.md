# Lab 03: Chirp (Twitter Clone)

### Git Setup:
```sh
> git checkout main
> git pull
> git checkout -b your-name/django/lab03
```

**Write a simple MVP (minimum viable product) clone of Twitter!**


*This lab is not race for the finish, take your time and ask lots of questions!*

*Now is a great time to practice your google-fu as well*

---
Your project is going to need 2 apps, `posts` and `users`.


Your project will also need to have the following functionality:
* User login / sign up
* The ability to post chirps of some constrained length (eg. 128 characters)
* A public profile page that shows all the users chirps
* Basic UI (navbar, footer) and styling (either by hand or with a framework)

## Optional advanced version

Make an Instagram clone! Your posts will need an associated image, check out the [instruction guide](../docs/06%20-%20Media%20Files.md).  
You will need to `pip install pillow` to have ImageFields in your database.

### Git Add, Commit & Push:
```sh
> git add files-to-be-added
> git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
> git push -u origin your-name/django/lab03
```
Then go to the repository to create a PR.
