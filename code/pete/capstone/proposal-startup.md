# Proposal Startup Guide:
1. Create a new GitHub public repo for your Django Capstone (name it what your project will be named––it can be changed at any time)
2. Be sure to include the Python `.gitignore` when creating the repo, and a `LICENSE` file if you want.
3. Create a file called `README.md` at the root of your repo.  This will be your capstone proposal.
4. Refer to the `README.md` in this folder for an example of a capstone proposal.

Check out [this example repo](https://github.com/pjz987/capstone_demo_macro_tracker) to see what your repo should look like once you've completed the proposal.
