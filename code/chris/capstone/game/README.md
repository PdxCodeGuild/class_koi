# storied_game

## Overview
Games are fun. For some, games are like sports and getting better at the game in a competitive setting is what makes it fun. For others, a game is like a movie or a book where the story and the characters are the center of what makes it fun. The goal of this project is to create a RPG-style game with a central focus on story, and small competitive elements, styled after wordle.  The project will be built in Django and Vue.js.

## Features
#### As a **lover of stories**, I want a **quick and socialized daily dose of RPG gaming** because **I'd like to game but not for a long time**.

### MVP:
  * input field for user to enter commands
  * a place for responses to render
  * an enemy for user to kill
  * an ending alert or change in state
  * track completion of this story

### Tasks:

* Create Django models
  * Playable character (name, health points (?))
  * Inventory (swords, shields, books, first aid kits)
  * enemies
  * game environment/map -- text based
    * the map might be the same as the story because it's text-based
* Create a place where all this info can render.

### Additional Features:
* API usage (?)
* Daily release of new stories
* Track user completion of stories and let them build streaks
  * 2 days in a row: Player
  * 5 days in a row: Hero
  * 14 days in a row: Mage
  * 30 days in a row: Master
  * 45 days in a row: Master Mage
  * 90 days in a row: Storied Hero
  * 180 days in a row: Legendary
* Additional stories availabe for purchase
