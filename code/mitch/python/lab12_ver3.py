A lot happens here. There are two for loops, one nested in the other. The first for loop occurs for each value in values.
The second for loop uses zip, which pairs up the key and value so that the day, temperature, and condition keys are assigned
to the appropriate value. The inner for loop runs 3 times because there are 3 of key in keys. The entire second for loop is 
enclosed in curly brackets so that produces a dicitonary for each day of weather. All of the data is in square brackets which
results in a list of dictionaries called 'weather_list'.
