                Our coaching is the heart of all we do. We are dedicated to helping athletes stay healthy, avoid injury, and improve performance. Our programs are highly individualized but are principle-based and are flexible. We build all of our coaching based on a 1-year overview, with the training broken down into 4-week focus blocks.
            </p>
            <p class="pa1 w-100"> 
                As an athlete, you'll have access to your program via the Climb Strong mobile app, and can communicate with your coach via the app or via email. Once each month, you'll have a special meeting with your coach to determine how well the previous plan worked, what's coming next, and any adjustments that need to be made.
            </p>
            <p class="pa1 w-100"> 
                In addition to your workouts, your coach will plan regularly scheduled tests and measurements to make sure you are on track. We'll help you not only with planning, but can work with you on exercise technique, climbing tactics, and even general fitness and weight management. Our coaching staff consult with a wide network of doctors, therapists, and dietitians to assure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
