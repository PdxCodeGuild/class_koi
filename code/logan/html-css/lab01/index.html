        Based on the title character of Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>, Dracula is one of the most iconic bosses in videogame history.  He debuted in the classic Konami game <i>Castlevania (1986)</i> for NES/FAMICOM in which he is defeated by the vampire killer

        He has risen from the dead many times since then and appeared in countless sequels, but there always seems to be a Belmont around to keep Drac down.<br>
