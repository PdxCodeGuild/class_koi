    <h1> Dracula (Castlevania) </h1>
    <p>
        Vampire. <br>
        Lord of the magical travelling castle Castlevania. <br>
        Eternal enemy of the Belmont clan. <br>
        <br>
        Based on the title character of Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dracula is one of the most iconic bosses in videogame history.  He debuted in the classic Konami game Castlevania (1986) for NES/FAMICOM where he was defeated by the vampire killer Simon Belmont.  He has risen from the dead many times since and appeared in countless sequels, but there always seems to be a Belmont around to keep Drac down.<br>
        <br>
        Eventually he is reincarnated as stylish Japanese teen Soma Cruz.  Look, it gets complicated...
