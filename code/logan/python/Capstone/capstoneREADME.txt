Project Purple 0.1AA
####################
This is the beginning of a longterm project.  In its current double alpha state, 
it is a program that takes in chord progressions from the user and creates
customizable bass lines, lead lines, harmony sections beats, and more as midi.
Multiple tracks can be created at once.  This makes it perfect for generating
MIDI for all kinds of purposes -- jam/practice session accompaniment, "starter
MIDI" that you can manipulate in programs like Ableton Live, and even genuine
mathematical composition.

I'm sure there are many, more powerful, GUI-er versions of this sort
of program out there and have been for some time.  But I can customize this endlessly with 
whatever musical puzzle pieces I want coded as functions.

All of this is made possible by utilizing the Python module mingus and Python fundamentals.
Unfortunately mingus, while powerful, is unfinished, and the scales subcore lacks
a lot of the planned functionality shown in the module's documentation.  The finished
version would make it *much* easier to write a wide variety of generalizable lead licks
without doing a bunch of extra work.  I may try to write some code to restore some of the
promised functionality, but it will take a little time.

Enjoy the demonstration!
