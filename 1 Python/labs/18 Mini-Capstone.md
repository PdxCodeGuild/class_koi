# Mini Capstone

### Git Setup:
```sh
> git checkout main
> git pull
> git checkout -b your-name/python/lab18
```

For your final Python project, build a program that solves a problem or accomplishes a task. Your program needs to utilize an external library (not part of the Python standard library -- this needs to be something that you `pip install`).  

The functionality of the program is up to you -- use this as an opportunity to get creative. Sometimes students explore an idea they want to use for their capstone project or solve an actual problem they have. For a list of Python libraries to consider using in this project, check out https://awesome-python.com

### Stand Ups

We will be doing twice-daily standups (9:30 am and 1:30 pm) during the development process.  The standups will be quick (30-60 seconds) progress updates.  They should answer 3 questions:
1. What did you do yesterday/in the morning?
2. What will you do this morning/afternoon?
3. What blockers, if any, do you have?

### Presentations
The presentations should be about 5 minutes long and include:
* A demo of your project
* A look at the code
* Time for questions

There is more info on presentations in the [README](../../README.md#student-presentations)

### Git Add, Commit & Push:
```sh
> git add files-to-be-added
> git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
> git push -u origin your-name/python/lab18
```
Then go to the repository to create a PR.
